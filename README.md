You'll need gpg and signing-party installed before running this

Debian/Ubuntu:
```
apt-get install signing-party
```

Mac OSX with homebrew:
```
brew install install gpg signing-party
```

First make sure your folder has the correct permission and then run update.sh:
```
chmod 700 .
./update.sh
```
